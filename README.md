## Usage

### Platform Selection

All commands support the `--platform` parameter to choose between ChatGPT and Gemini. The default is ChatGPT for backward compatibility.

### First-Time Setup (Required)

The very first time you run the tool, you must use the `--first-run` flag. This will open a visible browser window where you can log in to your account. Your session will be saved for all future runs.

**For ChatGPT (default):**
```bash
chat-librarian select --first-run
# or explicitly
chat-librarian select --platform chatgpt --first-run
```

**For Gemini:**
```bash
chat-librarian select --platform gemini --first-run
```

### Interactive Mode (Default)

Run the `select` command to get an interactive list of your conversations.

**ChatGPT:**
```bash
chat-librarian select --first-run
```

**Gemini:**
```bash
chat-librarian select --platform gemini --first-run
```

The tool will display a table of your conversations. Enter the number of the chat you wish to download.

### Download by Title

Use the `title` command followed by the exact, case-insensitive title of the conversation in quotes.

**ChatGPT:**
```bash
chat-librarian title "My Important Research Chat" --first-run
```

**Gemini:**
```bash
chat-librarian title "My Important Research Chat" --platform gemini --first-run
```

### Quick Mode: Download Last Chat

To quickly save your most recent conversation, use the `last` command.

**ChatGPT:**
```bash
chat-librarian last --first-run
```

**Gemini:**
```bash
chat-librarian last --platform gemini --first-run
```

### Known Issues

-   **Headless Mode**: Currently, running the tool in headless mode (i.e., without the `--first-run` flag) is unstable and may result in a timeout. For reliable operation, please use the `--first-run` flag for all commands, which will open a visible browser window to perform the automation. This will be addressed in a future update.
